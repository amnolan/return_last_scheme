# return_last_scheme
Returns the last item of a list

Scheme is a functional language with some imperative functionalities. The original intent of scheme was to 
implement a "Von Neumann" language, named for John von Neumann. Scheme is a later evolution of the programming language Lisp.

This is a language which is very unlike most modern programming languages. Most things are
accomplished through passing and chopping lists. Recursion is the most common way of accomplishing repeated tasks. 
It has a mathematical flavor to it, and works similar to function composition in traditional mathematics.

Given an input retLast returns an empty list if the list is empty, the whole list if the list is only one element or
the last element of the list if it is larger than size zero or one.

One of the major drawbacks of Scheme is it's not efficient and ill-suited to most common programming tasks. For instance,
it would not be an ideal language for developing web applications. It does have its place however, typically it is used for
building text-editing applications.
